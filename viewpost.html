                             <p>The match at the Stadio Olimpico - a 15:00 CET kick-off - pits second against third, 
                                with the result potentially having significant implications in the race for Champions League qualification.
                                See what Spalletti had to say about the game, the fallout after the Coppa Italia defeat against Lazio, 
                                and much more in the transcript below.
                                How do you go about picking yourselves up after losing the derby 2-0?
                                There&#39s a whole word behind that question. You can call into question everything we&#39ve done so far. 
                                I&#39ve lost around 200 matches since I became a coach. I&#39ve conceded 700 or 800 goals. 
                                We&#39ve played about 70 games since I came back here and we&#39ve lost 11 or 12 of them. 
                                We&#39ve conceded plenty of goals. "I&#39ve always had something to say whenever I&#39ve lost a match or conceded a 
                                goal and &#45; more importantly &#45; the players have always had work to do.
